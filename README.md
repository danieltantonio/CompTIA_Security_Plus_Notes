- **Malware**: Short for Malicious Software, that is created by a hacker. Meant to be ran on target machine.
- **Virus**: A type of malware or part of a malware. A virus replicates itself and spreads across other computers in the same network. But needs to be interacted with (such as opening up the file), in order to invoke and begin spreading.
- **Worm**: Very similar to a virus, but takes advantage of a vulnerability found within an operating system. So it doesn't need to be interacted with in order to run.
- **Trojan**: A type of malware that once executed, will give total control of the infected computer to the hacker.
- **Remote Access Trojan**: Is a trojan but the hacker doesn't have to be on the same network in order to take control.
- **Bot**: An already infected victim computer, controlled by a hacker.
- **Command and Control (CNC)**: A server that bots listen to, for incoming commands.
- **Fileless Virus**: A virus that instead of staying in your HDD, stays in RAM.
- **Logic Bomb**: A malware that runs after a certain amount of time or after a a specific action has been met.
- **Spyware**: A type of malware that spies on a victim and can steal their informaiton.
- **Rootkit**: A type of malware that gives a hacker full access to a victim's machine.
- **Backdoor**: Like a trojan, but will give the hacker a way back in if booted by victim.
- **Adversarial Artificial Intelligence**: An attack on AI/ML systems, to manipulate the input into obtain a preferred outcome.
- **Evasion**: To prevent detection by the server or AI/ML system.
- **Poisoning**: To change or manipulate the behivor of the server or AI/ML system.
- **Malicious USB**: A USB that once plugged into a computer, can execute malicious code.
- **Malicious USB Cable**: Same thing as Malicious USB, but meant to look like a USB cable *(e.g.) An iPhone charging cable*.
- **Card Cloning**: Hardware that scans the data from a card *(e.g.) A credit card, debit card, hotel room key*. Can maliciously be hidden at ATMs to look like the area to insert a card.
- **Supply Chain Attack**: An attack (usually cyber attack) on an organization's systems and data by implementing a backdoor into their products (typically software). This allows the attacker to deliver malicious products or software or patches.
- **Keylogger**: A monitoring system (usually software) that can be used to capture keystrokes. Can also be used maliciously by a hacker.
- **Hardware Keylogger**: Same thing as a keylogger but through hardware instead of software.
- **Keystroke**: The press of a key on a keyboard.
- **Hash**: A string of letters and numbers representing encrypted data.

## Prevention
- **Phishing** - Employee/User Training
- **Dumpster Diving** - Employee/User Training, Paper shredding
- **Shoulder Surfing** - Employee/User Training, Privacy screen installed onto computer monitor
- **Watering Hole Attacks** - User/Employee training. 
- **Malware**: User/Employee training, good anti-virus software, good firewall setup.

## Principles of Social Engineering
*These are principles as a way to trick a user/employee into giving up certain information*
- **Authority** - Trick user/employee into thinking you are somebody of importance. (e.g.) An admin user or a CEO of the company.

- **Urgency** - Get user/employee to do specific action by making them think you need them to do something immediately.

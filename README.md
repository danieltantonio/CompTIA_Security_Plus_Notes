- **Worm**: Very similar to a virus, but takes advantage of a vulnerability found within an operating system. So it doesn't need to be interacted with in order to run.
- **Trojan**: A type of malware that once executed, will give total control of the infected computer to the hacker.
- **Remote Access Trojan**: Is a trojan but the hacker doesn't have to be on the same network in order to take control.

## Principles of Social Engineering
*These are principles as a way to trick a user/employee into giving up certain information*
- **Authority** - Trick user/employee into thinking you are somebody of importance. (e.g.) An admin user or a CEO of the company.
